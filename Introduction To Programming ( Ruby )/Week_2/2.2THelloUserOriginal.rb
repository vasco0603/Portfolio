  # Example of how to read strings:

  s = read_string('Enter a String: ')
  puts("the string you entered was: " + s)

  # Example of how to read integers:

  i = read_integer('Enter an Integer: ')
  puts("The Integer you entered was: " + i.to_s)

  # Example of how to read floats:

  f = read_float('Enter a float (eg: 3.142): ')
  puts("The Float you entered was: " + f.to_s)

  # Get the curent year from the system:

  y = Date.today.year
  puts("the current year is: " + y.to_s)

	 # Now if you know how to do all that
   # Copy in your code from your completed
	 # hello_user Task 1.3 P. Then modify it to
	 # use the code in input_functions.
   # use read_string for all strings (this will
   # remove all whitespace)
